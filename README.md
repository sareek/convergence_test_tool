# The concept of convergence in the study of probability and random variables is one of the most crucial topics. 

In many real-world scenarios, we want to get the value of a random variable (say, X), but we can't calculate it directly. In such cases, we estimate the value of X by designing and conducting an experiment (either in the lab or with simulation); let's call it "Trial 1.". We do the same experiment for a number of trials and get the estimates X1, X2, X3, and so on, hoping that as the number of trials increases, the estimate of X gets better and better. As Xn gets closer and closer to X, we say Xn converges to X. In probability and statistics, there are many theorems that rely on the concepts of convergence. Some of the well-known theorems include the Central Limit Theorem, the Weak Law of Large Numbers, and the Strong Law of Large Numbers. To understand the concepts of convergence in detail, it is important to be more specific about what "convergence" actually means.

Convergence can be in distribution, probability, mean, or almost sure convergence. This repository presents a simulation tool (developed in MATLAB) to understand the concept of convergence with visualization tool, which was originally presented in a paper, ["Understanding convergence concepts: A visual-minded and graphical simulation-based approach"](https://www.stat.rice.edu/~dobelman/notes_papers/math/ConvergenceConceptsExplained.pdf). Readers are encouraged to go through the paper first before using the tool.

## Tools/concepts needed.

1. MATLAB tool version R2023a or higher.

2. Understanding of random variables and different types of distributions (uniform, normal, exponential) and their significance.
